Built a simple CRUD - "Build a Simple CRUD App with Python, Flask, and React"

Tutorial - https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/20/crud-app-with-python-flask-react

In this tutorial you are going to build a JavaScript application using React in the front-end and we are also going to build a ReST API written in Python which is going to persist. Our app will be a Github open source bookmark project (a.k.a kudo).

To complete this tutorial, there are few things you will need:

    macOS or Linux operating system
    Python 3 installed
    MongoDB or the Docker toolbox installed
    A free-forever Okta account
